# CRITICAL RULES - MUST BE FOLLOWED

## Code Implementation Rules
- NEVER implement code changes without explicit user permission
- ALWAYS ask "Should I implement this change?" before making any code modifications
- NEVER assume requirements - always ask for clarification
- When user says "don't apply anything by yourself without asking" - this means ASK FIRST, implement LATER

## Audio Processing Requirements
- Server-side FFmpeg processing is REQUIRED for stereo panning
- Client-side Web Audio API is NOT acceptable for native mobile platforms (Android/iOS)
- Stereo meditation requires server-side audio processing with FFmpeg
- Native mobile apps cannot use Web Audio API

## Project-Specific Rules
- This is a React Native meditation app with stereo meditation features
- Audio processing must work on Android, iOS, and Web platforms
- Server-side TTS synthesis with stereo panning is essential
- Do not break established working functionality

## Communication Rules
- Always ask for permission before implementing solutions
- If unsure about requirements, ask for clarification
- Do not make assumptions about platform capabilities
- Respect user's explicit instructions about implementation approach

## Error Prevention
- Do not repeat the same mistakes (like implementing Web Audio API for native mobile)
- Do not implement solutions without understanding the full requirements
- Always consider cross-platform compatibility
- Ask before changing established working code

## Development Workflow Rules
- NEVER commit and push directly to main branch (except documentation with [skip ci])
- ALWAYS create feature branches for code changes (e.g., `feature/description` or `fix/description`)
- ALWAYS test changes locally before pushing to feature branches
- ALWAYS ask "Should I create a feature branch for this change?" before implementing
- NEVER push untested code that could waste build minutes
- ALWAYS use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- ALWAYS create Pull Requests for code review before merging to main
- ALWAYS run type-check and lint before committing
- ALWAYS test on target platform(s) before pushing
- ALWAYS ask for explicit permission before creating branches or pushing code
- For documentation-only changes: commit directly to main with [skip ci] marker
- Only main branch triggers automatic builds and deployments
- Feature branches can trigger manual builds via GitHub Actions workflow_dispatch
