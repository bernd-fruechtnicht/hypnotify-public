# Background Music Assets

Place your background music files in this directory.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your audio file**: Place a single audio file named `breath-of-life_5-minutes-320858.mp3` in this directory
2. **Enable in settings**: Go to Settings → Audio → Background Music and toggle it on
3. **Adjust volume**: Use the Background Music Volume slider to set the level relative to speech

## Supported Formats

- **MP3** (recommended - best compatibility)
- **WAV** (high quality, larger file size)
- **M4A** (good compression, iOS optimized)

## File Requirements

- **File name**: `breath-of-life_5-minutes-320858.mp3` (exact name required)
- **Duration**: 3-10 minutes recommended (will loop automatically)
- **Quality**: 128kbps or higher
- **Volume**: Normalized to prevent clipping
- **Content**: Soft, ambient music suitable for meditation

## Recommended Audio Characteristics

- **Tempo**: Slow, calming (60-80 BPM)

## How It Works
